The following Repository Consists of Machine Learning Projects that I did during the courseworkk period of each subjects.

It consists of  projects :
  1. Breast cancer Prediction - The project uses machine learning models that predicts breast cancer using pre-existing models like Logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Random forest. Tuned the hyper parameters and analyzed the model's behaviour and its influence in our problem and requirements and made a case study.
  2. Classification of Harmful Insects in Agriculture - The project uses ensemble models to apply transfer learning to classify the insects of the Agriculture. It is trained with the insect datasets provided.
